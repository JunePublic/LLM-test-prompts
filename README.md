# LLM-test-prompts
Carefully crafted LLM single-turn multi-skill eval, designed for human output readability and ease of use. 

Generated on LMArena, with GPT-5-High and Gemini-2.5-Pro generating side by side. For each version, both outputs are then feed back, then the models are asked for judgement of which is better, then they refine that version, compete, and refine again, as a self-improving loop with manual human input. 

There are a few different versions of the test prompts avaliable.
